# SC2Blend
A Blender plugin script for importing saves and scenarios from awesome, 1993 game, SimCity 2000.

## How it works

- You'll need to decompress the sc2_blocks file, and relocate it to the directory you'll be working from.
- Then, open Blender, and import the script by either, going to preferences and making it a native script, or loading it into Blender's text editor and clicking "Run Script"
- If you didn't see any errors, go to File > Import > SimCity2000(.sc2), and select a file.

## Texturing
All of the blocks used to build your SimCity 2000 level are UV wrapped to the sc2_blocks_texture.png.
